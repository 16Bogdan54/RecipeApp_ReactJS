# Lunacooking - recipe app

Lunacooking is a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) for people who enjoy cooking at home. In this project I was practicing next technologies:

1. Getting data from an [api](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty)
2. Routing in react
3. Custom hooks
4. Animated page transitions

## How to use

To clone and run this app, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
